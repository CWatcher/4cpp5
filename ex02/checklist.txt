"the formâ€™s attributes need to remain private, and in the base class"

Bureaucrat::executeForm():
check is via try-catch, not via if ("It must attempt to execute the form")

What for this separate implementation:
PresidentialPardonForm::PresidentialPardonForm( const PresidentialPardonForm & src )
:	  Form( src )
{}
?
